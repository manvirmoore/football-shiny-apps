# football-shiny-apps
 A repo to contain any Shiny apps I create with football data. The first of these is going to be a Brighton dashboard, showing:
- a list of current players with their appearences and goal stats of all the clubs they've been at (filterable)
- the team's head to head results for each other team this season
- xG per game chart
